## Overview
The objective of this project is to predict the number one yields on newly created ready-to-cook (RTC) bacon products. This involves forecasting the amount of bacon from a belly that can be used for a primary product, influencing the costing of the product. Accurate costing is crucial for marketing and sales to predict margin and sell prices accurately. The project aims to create a model using quality assurance (QA) data, product specifications, and types of equipment to improve the precision of yield predictions.

## Built With
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Features
- Utilizes data from two bacon product plants in the United States.
- Combines assembly masters, QA information, and historical yields for model creation.
- Employs decision tree-based models, focusing on Random Forest Regression.
- Implements data preprocessing, dummy variable creation, and model evaluation techniques.
