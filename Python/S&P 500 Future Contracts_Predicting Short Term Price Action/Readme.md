## Overview
This project focuses on predicting short-term price actions for S&P 500 future contracts (/ES symbol). The objective is to streamline the prediction process and enhance trading strategies by forecasting movements within a 5-minute timeframe. With the end goal of beining implemented into binary logic gates to be used in a intra-day trading algorithm

## Built With
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost
- CatBoost

## Features
- Utilizes Kaggle's "Intraday market data" from February 2020 to July 2023.
- Extracts key features (/ES, /ES Volume) and converts them into 5-minute candlesticks.
- Computes various technical indicators, including SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator, and Fibonacci retracements.
- Implements logistic regression models for predicting binary price movements.
- Evaluates models' performance using accuracy and precision metrics.
